    <h3>How to play</h3>

    <p>Player 1 begins by placing an X anywhere on the board<br>
    Player 2 then has to place an O in the corresponding large game that player one placed their mark<br>
    If any player places a mark in a square where the big game has already been won, the next player can place their mark anywhere</p>

    <p>For example: Player 1 places their X on the top right square of the top left game. Player 2 will then have to
    place an O anywhere in the top right game</p>
