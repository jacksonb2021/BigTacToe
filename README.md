# BigTacToe
A web game created by Jackson Burns

### How to play

- Player 1 begins by placing an X anywhere on the board<br>
- Player 2 then has to place an O in the corresponding large game that player one placed their mark<br>
- If any player places a mark in a square where the big game has already been won, the next player can place their mark anywhere</p>

For example: Player 1 places their X on the top right square of the top left game. Player 2 will then have to
place an O anywhere in the top right game
